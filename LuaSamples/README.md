My LuaU work spans from 2017 to 2025 on Roblox, with many personal projects, some contributions to professional studios, and lots of research.

In 2021 I contributed significantly to the [Area-02](https://www.roblox.com/games/2808131030/NEW-CDC-SCP-Area-02) game which was at the time under [Octa Studios](https://www.roblox.com/communities/7189408/Octa-Studios#!/about). I contributed mainly to back-end player data storage systems and small bugfixes at the time.

I have few images/videos from this period, but here I am testing a bug where logs are showing up multiple times:

Some more recent work that never made it into a public game is this Minesweeper minigame I developed:

I also worked on both an unreleased RTS game (Siege) and an unreleased city/state open-world (Candor) around the 2020-2021 period.

A train prototype for Candor:

Some turrets for Siege:

Then going back to 2020, some SCP work on Blacksite-13:

1. Terminal control system for the rooms

2. Elevator with teleport transition

4. Some E-to-interact doors (predating ProximityPrompts, however I can use ProximityPrompts now.)

Before BS-13, there was an older Site-57 with this gorgeous animated keycard door:

In conclusion, I have been working on the Roblox platform for many years now, with a wide range of both personal and group projects, from small to large, and I look forward to re-engaging the Roblox development community.
