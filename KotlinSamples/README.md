My experience in Kotlin includes 4 personal projects on Android:
1. Rummikub: An app for taking pictures of the Rummikub board game and suggesting moves you can make.
2. Transactions: An app for tracking your spending, budgeting, and savings.
3. BusApp: An app for querying where buses are in my city of Ottawa at any given moment, and keeping a list of trips you have taken on them.
4. ImpulseFree: A simple app I made in a couple hours which asks you a series of questions inspired by an Instagram post, and recommends whether you should buy a given item impulsively or not.

I also worked for 5 months in a co-op program with National Proms for making an Android app to accompany their [Prom Vendors](https://promvendors.com) website. I am not permitted to share the code behind this app, but I can share information on features and APIs implemented, and screenshots.

I have experience following Android's recommended Material Design 3 standards for layout, theming, navigation, accessibility, and everything else that makes a clear and efficient app which is enjoyable to use. I have also applied Firebases Analytics and Firestore APIs to my apps at times, to learn how to integrate with cloud services.

Here are some screenshots of my apps in action:

1. The home screen of my BusApp:

2. The screen for logging a new transaction you have made in Transactions:
