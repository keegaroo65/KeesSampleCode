# Keegan Roy's Development Portfolio
Quick reference: See my samples for
1. [LuaU](/LuaSamples)
2. [C#](/CsSamples)
3. [Kotlin](/KotlinSamples)

Welcome to my portfolio, you may know me as keegaroo65, kee, or kee65. I will typically provide a recent resume alongside this portfolio.
I am an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, based developer. I have experience in many languages, I've always preferred back-end code but I now have a fair amount of experience in front-end as well, from my time in Kotlin for Android, and some web-based experiments.

I have proficient experience writing my own code, teaching myself new skills and languages, reading other people's code, reading documentation, and appropriately applying 3rd party/cloud APIs.

Below is a table of languages I have spent anywhere from a <b>few hours to potentially a thousand hours</b> coding in, along with the months I first started learning them, and how I would self-assess my proficiency based on my experience. Most recently I have focused on C# and Kotlin, but as I have the <b>fundamental logic-processing and problem solving skills, I can quickly pick up most languages just by learning the syntax</b>, especially when I have past experience with them.

| Lang. Name | Start Date | Proficiency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lua | Feb 2017 | ★★★☆ (3/4) |
| C# | Dec 2021 | ★★★☆ (3/4) |
| Java* | Sep 2022 | ★★☆☆ (2/4) |
| JavaScript | Sep 2023 | ★★☆☆ (2/4) |
| Kotlin | Oct 2023 | ★★☆☆ (2/4) |
| Python* | Sep 2021 | ★★☆☆ (2/4) |
| SQL | Apr 2024 | ★★☆☆ (2/4) |
| AHK** | Aug 2022 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |
| CSS* | Sep 2023 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |
| Html* | Sep 2023 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |
| C++ | July 2019 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |
| Go | Oct 2024 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |
| BASIC** | 2015/16 | ★☆☆☆ (1/4) |

\* I learnt Java, Python, Html, and CSS from high school and have used them minimally, the rest are self-taught
<br>** AutoHotKey and BASIC have only been useful briefly, AHK for making macros, and BASIC being my first programming language.

## Introduction
This portfolio serves as a collection of both full code samples, images, and videos, showcasing my work in various programming languages. The samples are divided into 3 folders which each have their own README files explaining the contents and showing some extra videos, as well as having a handful of full source code files.

<b>I recognize that working with a team requires a heavier committment to organization.</b> This includes practices such as unit testing capabilities, following version control, communicating with original authors of code (which is sometimes unavailable), commenting, and writing inherently readable and reusable compartmental code. At the end of the day, most of your comments should write themselves based on how you name your functions and organize and indent your code.

These code samples were taken directly from various projects of mine with no special editing beforehand, so you can see general organizational structures I follow both in front-end and back-end code, especially considering that some of this is up to 5 years old (my Roblox experience in particular). My code samples may not all follow best practices as they are often for personal projects, but I will demonstrate my ability to write readable code in a team.
